# Bullshit Bingo in Elm

A very simple and local implementation of bullshit bingo written in Elm. Uses webpack dev server to bundle the code and serve in local dev server, enabled with hot loading.

Note: This is still a WIP.

# Build Instructions

You will need to install webpack dependencies defined in package.json. Run:
```bash
npm install
```

To build code and bundle run:

```bash
npm run build
```

To build the code and start webpack-dev-server, run:
```bash
npm run client
```

Then go to http://localhost:3000 to see the game.
